# Final Project

This is a sleep tracker that will help the individual track the quality and time slept. This will be accomplished with use of an alarm and a simple rating system that will require input from the user each time they wake up and go to bed. These inputs will be quantified and translated into easy to read UI that will the user identify gaps in their sleeping habits
